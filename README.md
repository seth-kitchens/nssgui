# nssgui
NotSoSimpleGUI. An extension of PySimpleGUI. Still very much a work-in-progress. Sacrifices simplicity for productivity. Adds event handling, data flow management, a popup builder, expandable widgets ("GuiElements"), and other small things.

For now, this project is essentially just a separated piece of BackupScripter with plans to become an independent library.
